    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <div class="about-container">
      <p>
        I'm a person who loves <span>planning, code reviewing, drawing architecture and coding</span>.
        I'm a great team worker - I enjoy helping and listening to others' point of
        view but I also can guide myself as I have <span>experience as Tech Lead</span>. </br></br>
        I have <span>5 years of experience</span> working on <span>FrontEnd, BackEnd and DevOps (AWS/Azure)</span>.
        I also have had my fair share of dealing with bugs and quick solving problems in a
        production environment.
        When it comes to coding, I follow <span>clean code and patterns</span> chosen by the
        team to deliver a higher quality code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides tech, my <span>general interests</span> are gaming, reading, writing, studying,
        baking, finding out new music, playing bass guitar (I'm lousy at it but still have
        fun playing my favorite songs!), watching weird movies, travelling and collecting trinkets. </br></br>
        I'm a cyberpunk universe enthusiast, cat lover, rococo appreciator
        and a huge skincare enthusiast. Let's share our routines!

    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <div class="experience-container">
      <p>I have worked on both <span>legacy applications</span> as well as <span>applications made from scratch</span>;
      <span>Monoliths and microservices, API integrations, internal dev-use libraries,
        user-oriented command line tools</span> and much more. I'm used to automating repetitive stuff with
        scripts. I also have <span>experience leading a team</span>: planning tasks, doing pair programming,
      <span>reviewing code and giving detailed helpful comments</span> have been common parts of my job for the
        last years.
      </p>
